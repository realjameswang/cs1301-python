#We've talked about ordinal numbers before, but they can
#mean something else: "ordinal" is also the term for numbers
#like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.

#Write a function called to_ordinal. to_ordinal should
#take as input an integer greater than 0. to_ordinal should
#return a string of the ordinal of the integer (according to
#the above definition of ordinal).
#
#For example:
#
# to_ordinal(1) -> 1st
# to_ordinal(2) -> 2nd
# to_ordinal(3) -> 3rd
# to_ordinal(4) -> 4th
# to_ordinal(5) -> 5th
# to_ordinal(11) -> 11th
# to_ordinal(21) -> 21st
#
#Generally, ordinal numbers are always the original integer
#plus "th" _unless_ the original integer ended with 1 (in
#which case you add "st"), 2 (in which case you add "nd"),
#or 3 (in which case you add "rd")... except for 11, 12, and
#13, which still end in "th".


#Add your function below!
def to_ordinal(a):
    if str(a)[-1] == "1":
        if a == 11:
            return "11th"
        elif a == 12:
            return "12th"
        elif a == 13:
            return "13th"
        else:
            return str(a) + "st"
    elif str(a)[-1] == "2":
        return str(a) + "nd"
    elif str(a)[-1] == "3":
        return str(a) + "rd"
    else:
        return str(a) + "th"
