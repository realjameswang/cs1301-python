#Write a function called "angry_file_finder" that accepts a
#filename as a parameter. The function should open the file,
#read it, and return True if the file contains "!" on every
#line. Otherwise the function should return False. 
#
#Hint: there are lots of ways to do this. We'd suggest using
#either the readline() or readlines() methods. readline()
#returns the next line in the file; readlines() returns a
#list of all the lines in the file.


#Write your function here!
def angry_file_finder(filename):
    input_file = open(filename, "r")
    for line in input_file:
        if "!" not in line:
            return False
    return True
    input_file.close()

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: True
print(angry_file_finder("AngryFileFinderInput.txt"))
