#Below are the two class definitions we supplied previously:
#Artist and Song.
#
#Write a function called "get_song_string". It should accept
#one argument which will be a Song object. It should return
#a string in the following format:
#
# "<song name>" - <artist name> (<song year>)
# e.g: 
# "You Belong With Me" - Taylor Swift (2008)
#
#The quotation marks around the song title should be *part*
#of the string.
#
#Hint: You're writing a function, not a method. That means
#the function get_song_string should not be inside either
#of these classes.
