#In the designated areas below, write the three for loops
#that are described. Do not change the print statements that
#are currently there.

print("First loop:")

#Write a loop here that prints the numbers from 1 to 10,
#inclusive (meaning that it prints both 1 and 10, and all
#the numbers in between). Print each number on a separate
#line.
for i in range (1, 11):
    print (i)

print("Second loop:")

#Write a loop here that prints the numbers from -5 to 5,
#inclusive. Print each number on a separate line.

for i in range (-5, 6):
    print (i)

print("Third loop:")

#Write a loop here that prints the even numbers only from 1
#to 20, inclusive. Print each number on a separate line.
#
#Hint: There are two ways to do this. You can use the syntax
#for the range() function shown in the multiple-choice
#problem above, or you can use a conditional with a modulus
#operator to determine whether or not to print.

for i in range (1, 21):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print (i)
